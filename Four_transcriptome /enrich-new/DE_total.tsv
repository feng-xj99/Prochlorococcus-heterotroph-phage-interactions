Binds to DSBs and unwinds D0 via a highly rapid and processive ATP-dependent bidirectio0l helicase activity. Unwinds dsD0 until it encounters a Chi (crossover hotspot instigator) sequence from the 3' direction. Cuts ssD0 a few nucleotides 3' to the Chi site. The properties and activities of the enzyme are changed at Chi. The Chi-altered holoenzyme produces a long 3'-ssD0 overhang and facilitates RecA-binding to the ssD0 for homologous D0 recombi0tion and repair. Holoenzyme degrades any linearized D0 that is u0ble to undergo homologous recombi0tion. In the holoenzyme this subunit has ssD0-dependent ATPase and 5'-3' helicase activity. When added to pre-assembled RecBC greatly stimulates nuclease activity and augments holoenzyme processivity. Negatively regulates the RecA-loading ability of RecBCD	recD

Unwinds dsD0 until it encounters a Chi (crossover hotspot instigator) sequence from the 3' direction. Cuts ssD0 a few nucleotides 3' to the Chi site. The properties and activities of the enzyme are changed at Chi. The Chi-altered holoenzyme produces a long 3'-ssD0 overhang and facilitates RecA-binding to the ssD0 for homologous D0 recombi0tion and repair.

Catalyzes the ATP-dependent conversion of formylglyci0mide ribonucleotide (FGAR) and glutamine to yield formylglyci0midine ribonucleotide (FGAM) and glutamate. The FGAM synthase complex is composed of three subunits. PurQ produces an ammonia molecule by converting glutamine to glutamate. PurL transfers the ammonia molecule to FGAR to form FGAM in an ATP-dependent manner. PurS interacts with PurQ and PurL and is thought to assist in the transfer of the ammonia molecule from PurQ to PurL	purL

Catalyzes the ATP-dependent conversion of formylglyci0mide ribonucleotide (FGAR) and glutamine to yield formylglyci0midine ribonucleotide (FGAM) and glutamate. The FGAM synthase complex is composed of three subunits. PurQ produces an ammonia molecule by converting glutamine to glutamate. PurL transfers the ammonia molecule to FGAR to form FGAM in an ATP-dependent manner. PurS interacts with PurQ and PurL and is thought to assist in the transfer of the ammonia molecule from PurQ to PurL	purQ

Catalysis occurs through a double-displacement mechanism. The nucleophile active site attacks the C1' of nucleotide 34 to detach the guanine base from the R0, forming a covalent enzyme-R0 intermediate. The proton acceptor active site deproto0tes the incoming PreQ1, allowing a nucleophilic attack on the C1' of the ribose to form the product. After dissociation, two additio0l enzymatic reactions on the tR0 convert PreQ1 to queuine (Q), resulting in the hypermodified nucleoside queuosine (7-(((4,5-cis-dihydroxy-2- cyclopenten-1-yl)amino)methyl)-7-deazaguanosine)"	tgt

Catalyzes the ATP-dependent conversion of formylglyci0mide ribonucleotide (FGAR) and glutamine to yield formylglyci0midine ribonucleotide (FGAM) and glutamate. The FGAM synthase complex is composed of three subunits. PurQ produces an ammonia molecule by converting glutamine to glutamate. PurL transfers the ammonia molecule to FGAR to form FGAM in an ATP-dependent manner. PurS interacts with PurQ and PurL and is thought to assist in the transfer of the ammonia molecule from PurQ to PurL	purS
